Document the Protocol Buffers contract for this operation, including messages, fields, streaming behavior, examples, and errors.

## Details

### PBC Auth Request

Sends a username (`user`) and password (`password`) to Riak as part of
an authentication request. Both values are sent as binaries.

#### Request

```protobuf
message RpbAuthReq {
    required bytes user = 1;
    required bytes password = 2;
}
```

For more on authentication, see our documentation on [Authentication and Authorization](/kv/3.4.1/how-to/secure/enable-security/).
